# Problem Domain
I am accustomed to creating RESTful APIs, particularly with Python libraries such requests or FastAPI. 
I desire to learn more about MCP servers and to become proficient in leveraging FastMCP as a tool to expose
APIs to AI/LLMs.

# Solution: Learning Project
Leverage the US National Weather Service Open Data APIs as a data source to build a simple MCP server.  

## Objectives
1. Utilize FastMCP to expose Weather Service Alerts API
2. Build out FastMCP with its additional parameters
   1. Resources
   2. Prompts

# The Plan
1. Build baseline functionality with Python requests
    - This will provide confirmation that weather alert data is successfully being returned from the Weather Service.
2. Add in my logging routines - transition print statements to proper logging methodology
3. Convert from Python request library to FastMCP
    - Perform validation testing
    - Connect with local AI clients - Claude and ChatGPT
4. Extend with additional FastMCP parameters: resources, prompts
